# game-library - On Hold

Research project for making games using just OOP.

Project follows:
- API-first approach
- Healthy DI composition (say **NO** to DI-containers)
- SOLID
- Polling and pushing should be done through contract methods (say **NO** to observers)

And:
- **NO** frameworks (IoC is bad practice)
- **NO** harmful architecture patterns (like ECS, MV*, Event Bus an so on)
- **NO** typecasting or any reflection whatsoevere
- **NO** pure fabrication

Challenge? Yes. But this is something that should have ever happened.

## Future
Every module will eventually go into its own package at some point. Research results will be reflected in [this](https://forcepusher.notion.site/c4bef9b08512425d9333ca70e423600e) (or another) article.
